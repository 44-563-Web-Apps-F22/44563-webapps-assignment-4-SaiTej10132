    <h5>Act 2</h5>
    

        <p>
            FIA.    <br>     Though obedience is strong,
            Curiosity's stronger—
            We waited for long,
            Till we couldn't wait longer. <br>

            VIT.   <br>     It's imprudent, we know,
            But without your society
            Existence was slow,
            And we wanted variety—<br>

            BOTH. <br>   Existence was slow, and we wanted variety.<br>

            ALL.  <br>   So here we are, at the risk of our lives,
            From ever so far, and we've brought your wives—
            And to that end we've crossed the main,
            And don't intend to return again!<br>

            (Enter Gianetta and Tessa.  They rush to the arms of Marco and
            Giuseppe.)

            GIU.   <br>   Tessa!<br>
            TESS. <br>    Giuseppe! {All embrace.}<br>
            GIA.   <br>   Marco!
